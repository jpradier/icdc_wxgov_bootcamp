# 🔬 AI Governance Hands-on labs

AI Governance encompasses three pillars:

- **Model Inventory**
- **Model Evaluation and Monitoring**
- **Model Risk Governance**


There's two labs touching on different aspects of these pillars:

--- 
### ⛑️ [Lab 1: Guardrails and monitoring](monitoring-and-guardrails/README.md)
In this lab, María, an AI Engineer working for ABC health. She is building an AI application to help employees answer questions on their benefits. However, she's afraid of many potential risks related to Generative AI, namely generation of harmful contents, hallucinations, toxity, confidence, among others. Additionally, she's looking for ways to automate the process of evaluating different LLMs, prompts, and techniques.

### ⚠️ [Lab 2: Risk and compliance](risk-and-compliance/README.md)
As organizations increasingly rely on AI-driven decision-making, ensuring trust, compliance, and ethical integrity of models is crucial. At TechCorp Inc., the risk and compliance team faced growing pressure to govern AI models end-to-end—from inception to incident remediation. Manual checks, siloed responsibilities, and lack of visibility into model behavior increased regulatory exposure and audit fatigue.

This hands-on lab guides you through implementing a comprehensive AI governance framework using IBM watsonx.governance.
